"""A few useful functions for working with FASTA files and running jobs.

This module was originally written to hold common code used in both the TMHMM
and SignalP wrappers in Galaxy.

Given Galaxy currently supports Python 2.4+ this cannot use the Python module
multiprocessing so the function run_jobs instead is a simple pool approach
using just the subprocess library.
